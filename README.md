## Project Description: Conversational Bot Flight Booking App

In this assessment, you will be responsible for building a backend application that will be integrated with a conversational bot to facilitate flight ticket bookings. The main functionalities of the backend application should include:

 

1. Retrieving available flights based on the user's input (departure city, destination city, and date).

2. Presenting the user with a list of available flight options.

3. Handling user selection of a specific flight and confirming the booking.

4. Storing the booking information in a mock database or a data file.

5. Integrating with a mock payment system for booking confirmation (no actual payment processing required).

6. Providing appropriate error handling for invalid inputs or unexpected scenarios.

 

## Technical Requirements:

1. The backend application should be developed using your preferred programming language and framework.

2. Use RESTful APIs to handle communication between the frontend (conversational bot) and the backend.

3. You are encouraged to use any libraries or packages that you deem necessary to complete the task efficiently.

4. Include comprehensive unit tests to demonstrate the reliability and functionality of your code.

 

## Submission Details:

1. Please submit your completed assessment in or before 12th August 2023.

2. Upload the project to a code repository (GitHub, GitLab, or any other platform) and share the link with us.

3. Provide clear instructions on how to set up and run the application locally for testing purposes.

 

## Evaluation Criteria:

1. Code Quality: We'll assess the readability, maintainability, and efficiency of your code.

2. Functionality: Your backend application should fulfill all the specified requirements.

3. Integration: The application should communicate effectively with the conversational bot and handle user inputs gracefully.

4. Error Handling: Appropriate measures should be taken to handle errors and edge cases.

5. Testing: The presence of comprehensive unit tests will be a significant plus.

6. Documentation: Clear and concise instructions on setting up and running the app will be appreciated.
